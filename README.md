Boundless is a tool with two important parts:

- a set of functions that let you write visual-novel style scenes in real Livescript (Javascript) without worrying (too much) about async
- a scene selector to enable loosely-ordered scene structure similar to a random encounter table but with prerequisite checking

-POLM

All rites reversed, do as you like.
